## Introduction

This aim of this project is to code a function that returns a line, read from a file descriptor and to learn about static variables.

The subject of the project can be found in [this link](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/angelamcosta/get_next_line/main/en.subject.pdf).

## Mandatory part

###  Get_next_line

- :white_large_square: get_next_line

### Bonus part

<details open>
<summary> Bonus part </summary>

- To succeed get_next_line with a single static variable.
- To be able to manage multiple file descriptors with your get_next_line. For example, if the file descriptors 3, 4 and 5 are accessible for reading, then you can call get_next_line once on 3, once on 4, once again on 3 then once on 5 etc. without losing the reading thread on each of the descriptors.
